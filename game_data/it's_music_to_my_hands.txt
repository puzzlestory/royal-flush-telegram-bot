lucky charm that came my way

what time the show begins?

i got ace in the sleeve

everything on deck, i got ace

get me a gambling woman

playing for the high one

power, strength and virtue

the joker ain't the only fool

she'll be breaking your fall

last rhymes were just a joke

the gifts that you would give her

old man gonna roll on home

but if the legend ever fades

a freight train in the dark

she was old enough to know

it was a game whoâ€™s the winner
